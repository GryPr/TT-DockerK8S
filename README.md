# Concordia TechTalk - Introduction to Docker and Kubernetes

This repository contains the files relevant to my "Introduction to Docker and Kubernetes" Tech Talk in the ENCS Concordia Discord server. 

## Abstract

Since the start of Docker in 2013, containers have become widely adopted by most tech companies as a way to efficiently develop and deploy software in production. For instance, Google, as the original author of Kubernetes, deploys all of its services in containers.

In this talk, I will be introducing the basic concepts of containers, and how to deploy a simple REST API written in Go inside of a Docker container. I will then introduce Kubernetes, an open-source container orchestration system, which can automatically manage and deploy containers. We will then be deploying our REST API application inside a Kubernetes cluster while exposing the required endpoints to the outside world.
